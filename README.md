# PHP Loose Comparison and Null Values
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: unexpected behavior when using loose comparison with null values.  The `bug.php` file shows code that can produce incorrect results due to loose comparisons. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version that explicitly handles null values to ensure accuracy and prevent potential bugs.  This is a crucial consideration for robust PHP development, especially when dealing with user input or data from external sources.  The example focuses on a simple function to clearly illustrate the issue and its solution.  Remember to always explicitly check for null values where appropriate in your PHP code to avoid unexpected results and maintain code quality.
